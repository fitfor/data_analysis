# data_analysis
This repository provides data analysis and the ML-Backend of our data app.

The key technologies:
- MLxtend
- Flask

With Flask the REST server was built. The MLxtend library provides an implementation for the association rules,
the convenient think is the C implementation. The Pandas package was used only for data manipulation.

The Algorithm used for the computation of personalised recommendations is called association rules.
